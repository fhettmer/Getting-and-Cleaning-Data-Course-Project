Variables and data sets
X_train: referencing on data to Training set
y_train: referencing on data to Training labels

X_test: referencing on data to Test set
y_test: referencing on data to Training labels

x_data : merge data set of X_train, X_test
y_data : merge data set of y_train and y_test

averages_data.txt: contains averages by activity and subject

mean: Extract of measurement on mean
std: Extract of measurement on standard deviation

Transformations
Step1a: Read data sets.
Step1b: Merging the training and the test sets to create a data set for each x and y.
Step2: Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step3: Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Step4: Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step5: Creating a second data set from the data set in step 4 with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
